Imagine if crops could talk
What if crops could tell you their exact location, acreage, variety, yield and harvesting time?
‍
Or when and where a disease or pest attack is likely to occur, even health, stress, nitrogen, soil organic matter, the most productive zones and moisture levels. Be it from today’s date, or historically spanning across years.
Harnessing the power of AI and space technologies, we create vast crop data that is both accurate and actionable.
‍
Till date, we have  covered +500 million acres, and have empowered many agribusinesses and allied industries to create  impact within their community, for the planet and in their business.
We use AI & space technologies at scalefor sustainability in agriculture.

Our Mission
Our mission is to empower farmers and businesses with actionable data to lower costs, increase yield, enhance quality and reduce waste.
Our vision
Our vision is to use data and artificial intelligence to build a food secure world.
How Farmdar began
The story of Farmdar begins on the founder’s own family farms.
As fourth generation farmers, practices and ground technologies had changed, but the accurate and insightful data to create sustainable change was still missing.
We began by creating crop health and stress data across 600 acres, and gradually developed products that could
help us reduce waste,reduce input cost, and maximize yields.
Once we realized
the power of AI backed precision agriculture
, we began to work closely with sugar factories, food processors, seed, crop protection and fertilizer companies, to give accurate crop data across
hundreds of millions of acres.
This data driven approach to agribusiness has helped them
reduce their climate impact
, while increasing
supply chain efficiency
and enhancing
planning
,
pricing strategies
and
overall business productivity.
Global need for Farmdar
The world’s population is set to exceed
10 billion people in just 30 years.
Global temperatures are expected to
rise
by1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050.
By then, the world’s food production will need to be doubled
.Simply growing more food for a larger population on moreland is not the solution.
That scale of agricultural activity is a recipe for climate catastrophe. With as much as 30% of the world’s agricultural production being lost or wasted, Farmdar makes agriculture sustainable and helps businesses reduce their climate impactwhile increasing productivity and efficiency.
Food Processor
Procurement Head
"Farmdar has been transformative for our food processing operations. Their crop monitoring has been instrumental in sourcing top-quality potatoes, while digitizing field activities has allowed us to make quick decisions based on solid data."
Textile
Agri Business Head
"Our partnership has been a game-changer for our organic cotton production. The tech introduced by Farmdar let us precisely identify organic cotton acreages in the remotest areas and provided complete seed-to-bale traceability. This is preparing us for thefuture of exports."
Sugar Mill
IT & Audit Head
"Working with Farmdar has been transformative for our business.We not only detected sugarcane for better procurement, but also sugarcane varieties to create varietal impact over the next 5 years."
Sugar Mill
Procurement Head
"We are delighted with the exceptional services rendered by Farmdar, superior to all other services we have tried. Their diligent approach, profound understanding of our sugar mill culture, and attention to detail have significantly enhanced our cane procurementprocesses and audit."
Sugar Mill
GM Cane
"Farmdar’s CropScan helped our team discover sugarcane in our main procurement area, yet outside of our knowledge. We procured record levels of sugarcane in the ‘23-’24 season."
Sugar Mill
GM Cane
"Farmdar’s Harvest Monitoring reports were instrumental in informing us about the sugarcane remaining in our area. Our teams did nothave to work in panic mode and the impact on pricing strategywas excellent."
Sugar Mill
Chief Technology Officer
"With Farmdar’s Variety Classification we have started managing the problem of non-variety sugarcane cultivated in our area. We made great grower interventions, provided quality variety sugarcane seed, and have secured excellent recovery rates for next year."
Sugar Mill
GM Finance
"We closely monitored our loanee farmers, and made sure that we recovered our total amount during the first few weeks of season. Their (Farmdar’s) cane reporting enabled this, and the teamsupport was excellent."
Seed & Crop Protection
Regional Head
"Farmdar’s crop data has helped us to formulate an extremely strong business model for 2024 in terms of inventory stock levels, potential product demand, and establishing strong dealer networks in theright areas. Their committed efforts, high speed, and positive work ethic ensured that we received country-wide data just in timefor national planning."
Seed & Crop Protection
Marketing & Commercial Lead
"This is world class technology. Farmdar’s data has proved itself to be extremely useful in telling us where to target our marketing efforts. CropScan empowered us to identify maize hotspots, and trends across the Punjab province which enables us to market our maize products in a systematic, streamlined, & planned manner."
Food Processor
Head of Agri
"Farmdar’s crop monitoring and productivity zone analytics served as the backbone of our first corporate project. They were instrumental in helping select the most productive farmers, monitored crops throughout the cycle, and took ownership of our project, acting as business stewards alongside the role of an AI agritech. Farmdar is one of the reasons the project has received a managementgreen-light for a larger scale."
Sugar Mill
Head of IT
"Farmdar’s CropScan reports improved our operations from end to end. In addition to enabling effective procurement, they helped us identify the overall crop trends in our area. This enabled us to approach growers and persuade them to grow more sugarcane.This year we are aiming to procure more sugarcane local to ourarea than ever before!"
Fertilizer
Business Operations Analyst
"Farmdar  gave us the actionable knowledge to identify, and target a new territory for expansion and increasing sales. Our expansion is proving to be one of the most successful in recent years as the intel we received was extremely insightful, reliable, and was the basis of our channel strategy and commercial planning."
Forestry & Tree Count
CEO
"Tree-count data across a large area using traditional methods was very unreliable. Farmdar created a custom methodology for our area where trees are very small, and gave us clear data we could action on, covering planted, lost trees and density. We monitored on ground progress from our offices with better accuracy and much lowerteam cost."
Seed & Crop Protection
Country Head
"Farmdar is not only a tech company: They spend lots of time understanding the business challenge and view the solution from an agri perspective. Their data helped us predict demand impacted sales, and enabled our farmers to take proactive measures for pests and diseases."
